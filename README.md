Simo.js
=======

Simo goes javascript

### Running local development version
- clone repo
- remove .example postfix from settings files
- uncomment ircdjs-server from docker-compose (only if you want to use local irc server)
- run docker-compose up

All logs are redirected to container stdouts so docker-compose logs <--follow> is your friend

#### Feature development

- See features/example.js

#### Project Management
